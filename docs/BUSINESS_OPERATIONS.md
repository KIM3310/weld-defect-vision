# Business Operations Plan

This checklist translates the repository's current product and operating docs into concrete launch tasks. It is planning guidance, not legal, tax, or financial advice.

## Commercial position

- Commercial role: **technical proof asset**
- Monetization path: **technical credibility for consulting and partnerships**
- Secondary path: **public product demonstration**
- Repository visibility: **public**

## Deployment lane: static-preview-first

- Use a preview deployment first; Cloudflare Pages or GitHub Pages are the lowest-friction static lanes.
- Before custom domain/DNS, verify no secrets, no customer data, and no unsupported revenue claims are published.
- Prefer screenshots or a gated preview link for sales until privacy/support/payment pages are approved.

## Payment lane: manual-invoice-first

- Use manual invoice/proposal until offer, support, refund, and privacy boundaries are approved.
- Hosted payment links can be added later without code once account setup is complete.

## Privacy and data lane: privacy-standard-minimize-data

- Inventory personal data, customer data, logs, analytics identifiers, uploaded files, and model prompts before launch.
- Collect the minimum data needed; define retention, deletion, access control, incident response, and data export/deletion request handling.
- Publish a plain-language privacy policy before collecting contact, analytics, payment, or uploaded-file data; this draft is not legal advice.

## Customer support lane: best-effort-community-support

- Use GitHub Issues/Discussions for non-sensitive feedback.
- Do not promise response times until a paid plan or pilot contract exists.

## Launch blockers that must stay explicit

- Activate payment only after account ownership, KYC, tax, refund, and support terms are confirmed.
- Privacy policy/terms/refund language requires owner/legal review before customer data or money collection.
- Assign an owner for production deployment, domain/DNS, analytics, and support-channel changes before launch.

## Pre-launch checklist

- [ ] Run the repo-specific verification command before release.
- [ ] Run a redacted secret scan before release and resolve or document any findings.
- [ ] Public copy avoids revenue guarantees and unsupported legal/medical/financial/security claims.
- [ ] Privacy policy, terms/refund policy, and support scope are approved by the owner before publication.
- [ ] Payment account/KYC/tax configuration is complete before accepting money.
- [ ] Support inbox, escalation owner, response window, and customer-data handling are ready.
- [ ] Production deployment, custom domain/DNS, analytics, and email capture have named owners and rollback plans.

## Support macros

- **Bug intake:** ask for environment, reproduction steps, expected/actual result, logs with secrets removed, and impact level.
- **Paid pilot intake:** capture buyer, use case, data sensitivity, success metric, deadline, access constraints, and decision owner.
- **Refund/escalation:** acknowledge within the promised support window, preserve the order/customer reference privately, and escalate policy exceptions to the owner.
- **Data request:** verify requester identity through the approved support channel, avoid public issue threads, and log deletion/export actions.
