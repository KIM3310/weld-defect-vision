# Service Architecture - weld-defect-vision

This document keeps the public architecture plan focused on deployment boundaries, operational readiness, and resource ownership.

## Technical Role

- **Lane:** Repository-specific proof surface and implementation reference
- **Primary reader:** Technical reviewers, operators, maintainers, and partners
- **First motion:** Validate the live demo, README, architecture notes, and local checks before expanding the runtime surface.

## Recommended Architecture

~~~text
User or reviewer
  -> public proof surface
  -> scoped app/API layer only when state or integrations are required
  -> managed data, object storage, queue, and observability after ownership is clear
  -> signed report, demo, export, or operating handoff
~~~

## Resource Plan

| Resource | Use | Enable timing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static hosting | Public, cacheable proof surface and documentation. | Keep as the default until server-side state is required. |
| App/API runtime | Small API runtime for authenticated workflows, integrations, or server-side jobs. | Enable after the workflow requires state or external calls. |
| Data layer | Relational state, audit history, roles, or workflow records. | Enable after retention and deletion rules are defined. |
| Object storage | Uploads, reports, screenshots, model artifacts, or signed exports. | Enable only when persistent artifacts are required. |
| Queue/cache | Async jobs, retries, scheduled checks, and rate-limited workflows. | Enable when reliability needs exceed direct request handling. |
| Observability | Error tracking, performance traces, and privacy-safe usage signals. | Enable before external users test the workflow. |

## Repo-Specific Resources

- Public demo or static proof route
- CI or local quality gate
- Architecture blueprint validation
- Secret manager for any future credentials
- Privacy-safe telemetry only when needed

## Information Needed From Account Owner

- Hosting account and deployment target
- Domain or DNS access when a custom domain is required
- Runtime secret names and ownership
- Data retention and deletion policy
- Observability project and alert routing

## Production Readiness Checklist

- Public demo route or README proof link is current.
- Service boundary states what the system does and does not do.
- Data storage, retention, and deletion path are defined before private data is accepted.
- Secrets are stored in platform secret managers, never committed to the repo.
- Usage alerts or manual approval gates are enabled before external testing.
- Logs and analytics avoid private payloads.
- Rollback or disable path exists for every external integration.
